MEETING WITH HANS AND EVELYNN ABOUT OUR PRESENTATION (by Thomas ðŸ˜Ž)
Slide number:
1. Title is not conclusive, will meet over the weekend to figure it out.
2. Background
3. Cool animations
4. Research Q.
5. Background for research q. One thing we should emphasize is that sociodemographic metadata are not looked at it, and we should work to humanize these factors. Highlight the fact that there is a lack of research between the gut microbiome and human factors. 
6. Hypothesis
7. Aim 1 --> p-value table. There is one significiant comparison in Pielou's evenness between age and the gut microbiota in HIV+ patients. The difference is not big, and FDR has not been done. For the paper, use p-values instead of colors. Color the p-values or add a opaque background fill to the cell (binary yes or no is okay, no need gradient). Evenlynn inquires about education. Maybe we should clarify the bins (primary, secondary, tertiary) and what they mean. Hans mentions that the colon is probably a bad way of listing the factors, instead use "Labor vs Non-labor" instead of "Labor: Non-labor". Evenlynn says she wouldn't dig into it, difference is too small.
8. Hidden
9. Hidden
10. Aim 2 core microbiome analysis. The p-values are very small (nvm fixed!). The numbers are "species in common". Evelynn inquires about the threshold and deduces that it is 0. Keep adjusting it so it's more stringent than 0. Hans says prevalence 0.1 is still too low (not meaningful).
