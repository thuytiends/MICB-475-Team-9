# LN02 - Denoiseing and Clustering

Feb 28th, 2025

## Purpose:
To detect and fix any sequencing errors, and to cluster the sequences into respective ASVs

## Material: 
1. QIIME2 
2. team6_dysautonomia_paired_demux_seqs.qza (/data/team6_dysautonomia_data)
3. dysautonomia_metadata.tsv (/mnt/datasets/project_2/dysautonomia)


## Method:
1. Connect to Cisco Anyconnect Secure VPN. Open the terminal and login to MICB 475 class server using the provided login credentials.
2. Create a detached screen
3. Denoise and cluster the demultiplexed sequences using DADA2
4. Visualize the ASVs by converting qza files to qzv.
5. Transfer the visualization files to local computer and view the representative sequences and table.qzv using view.QIIME2.org

   
## Code: 
* [QIIME2]
## Output files:
Files are saved on Team OneDrive server

   
## Results: 
*  Files were denoised and clustered

## Discussion:
* Materials are now ready to perform taxonomic analysis
