# Agenda
### Notetaker: Susana, Savitha 
- discussion of Aim 3

## Meeting minutes
- Can average z score but not ideal for a heatmap 
- heatmap for labor and non-labor
--> cannot make any conclusions
--> this will be a figure - Hans along with the DESeq plot
---> Steven: no conclusion, we see no significant difference between the groups
--> significant comparing appearance rate, it is the number of appearance
-------> Steven: there is a significance different in the appearance rate between labor and non-labor
------------> biological does not appear very strong but significantly they are different
-----------------> But they are some that are very overrepresented 

- Age group patients 
--> Hans: why the bar plot with pathways (from savitha) is pvalue instead of z value
-----> Savitha: cuz it is log2foldchange
-----> Hans: only take the log2foldchange of above and below (-1.5 or above 1.5) OR 1 
---------> it is good; dont need to have it colored by p value
------------->Hans: remove p-value and only keep the top 10 upregulated and downregulated


- HIV positive only
-----> only look at HIV positive patient
-----> eg. labor category, this bacteria is upregulated and if it is beneficial to the patient

Figures: try to workout with the layout that is all consistent and can see the text 
element text size 16 (for axis text), 18 for axis title
- dont overcrowd one slide with figures
- should be 1min per slide


- Education
----> how higher education are commonly have downregulated with prevotella 
----> Hans: need to think outside of education; eg. grinding more because of the job that you do, then cannot eat due to time crunch; dont think that just because someone went to higher education we could assume
----> Steven: the consistent observation is that prevotella is downregulated in primary and secondary patients is an interesting result and in the discussion and further investigation with control of confounding variables
----> Hans: look for literature previous studies if they have done studies on this; microbes dont cause HIV; can always include education negative in the supplementary;
--------> can reference in the results the supplementary figures but there is no limit; still need caption
------->Tien: prevotella is associated to type 1 diabetes but it is because of genetics
--->Prevotella 1 and prevotella 2; it is probably because it is two species but can Blast it the ASVs
