# Meeting with Hans #
## Location: LSI, time: 3pm
## Agenda:
  * Discuss project progress: Aim 1: alpha and beta diversity of labor types
  * Compare results between members
  * Ask for feedback
  * Questions regarding codes
## Meeting notes:
  * Any chat about proposal? Nope
  * 

### All the data figures format by march 21st, better to discuss as we have

# MEETING MINUTES AND FEEDBACK
* AHHHH I WAS LATE
* Put age instead of old/young, put instead <45 and >45; inctrase y scale limit; do FDR analysis false discovery rate
* For statistically signifcant with respect to age, sample size for one group was larger than the rest
* use geom point or geom_violin; why is there only 2 points for negative primary education; also consider richness - numbern of observed species
* High PD value means that the population are more diverse
* Color theme --> use scale_fill_manual(values = c("color1", "color2", ..., "colorx")), use color brewer to find ccool color (diverging = n1 to nx, qualitative = just as different as possible, color blind safe!)
* Make sure scale_fill is consistent, add theme_classic() at the end; always add x and y into aes to keep track; add aes into geom_point with group = education level
* The dataset is a little cooked
* Add points --> geom_point(aes(x = ..., y = ...)), okay but this is not working??
* Age: Old and young significantly different within HIV positive, ns for HIV negative data point 
    Increase Y scale limit, use argument called limits and takes a vector
    Limits = c(*upper limit, lower limit))
    Change old and young to actual numbers eg. >35
    for P values: did you test FDR
    in the median falls between the quartile is skechy but if it falls outside you can trust it
    use the violin plot instead of the box plot for the analysis in aim 1
