# Meeting with Evelyn #
## Location: BIOL3016, time: 3pm
### Notetaker: Tien
## Agenda:
  * Discuss figures and story flow
  * Ask for feedback
  * Questions regarding codes
## Meeting notes:
  * Table 1: add p-values in directly, if significant, add the "*" => just means significant
  * Figure 1: panel looks good
  * Table 2: ISA table which value is better - WE DO WANT P VALUES AND ISA VALUE - don't worry about format, evelynw will take care of that
  * Figure 2: volcano plots (5 panel figures)
  * Figure 3: Reference group ALWAYS ON THE RIGHT
  * Compare heatmaps and barplots: don't bother, heatmaps might not be normalized and so the Z score isn't trustable 
  * Suppelmental: DESEQ bar plots
  * Education: any story?
     * Just say there's nuanced difference, nothign to discuss about it
     * Although we didn't pinpoint major differences, we did find some minor changes in small subset of patients
     * Don't care much about metadata
     * leaning towards the trends but due to sample sze, it might be hard for us to tell.
