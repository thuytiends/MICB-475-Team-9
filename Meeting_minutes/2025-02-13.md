# Meeting with Hans on Zoom 
3:45-4:30pm Thursday
## Agenda
 ### Research question: Investigation of gut microbiome in HIV patients with different labour categories and related cortisol effects
 * when is this cortisol amount collected? before or after
 * good, novel question, research question is more of a title - try to set a big question
 * being graded on the rubric - look at the rubric
 ### Experimental aims:
 * Aim 1: What is the gut microbiome composition and diversity within each labor category of HIV-positive and negative patients? (alpha diversity Shannon index). How do occupational labor type influence gut microbiome composition in HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals? (beta diversity Weighted Unifrac, difference among labor types, between HIV +/-)
 * Aim 2: What is the corresponding cortisol level for each occupational labor type between HIV-positve and negative patients and difference between groups? (comparison and statistical test)
 * Aim 3: What is the relationship between occupational labor type, cortisol levels, and gut microbiome diversity in HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals? (correlation analysis)
 ### Outline the planned analysis (alpha, beta diversity, etc.)
 * Aim 1: alpha diversity Shannon index
 * Aim 2: Beta diversity weighted Unifrac
  * statistical comparison between labor types within HIV+/-, between HIV + and -
 * Aim 3: Comparison and statistical test
 * Aim 4: Correlation analysis PCoA 
 ### Feedback from Hans
 * go through the QIIME2 analysis for the dataset first: rarefaction curve, analysis, look for example of proposal online - see if you end up losing all the samples 
 * don't ask for alternative rurbic marking
 * envision to have one aim per figure
 * Aim 1 and 2 should be combined
 * for aim, try to set it as statement rather than questions
 *  e.g. develop a computational pipeline for microbe community (what and why structure)
   * characterize microbial dynamics and osmotic stress in the gut
   *  develop an assay to xyz
   *  based it on gut microbiota
   *  typical amount of figures
 * Aim 3: need to manipulate your data at this point
   * turn it into categorical
   * need evidence to back it up
   * low, med, high
   * looking at 3 categorical variable +/-, labor type, cortisol level
   *  you can do this but this is gna be a lot of combinations => need to work with that and get useful data out of it
   *  aim 3: still sounds like it's diversity analysis
  * Aim 4: what would you be doing - should collapse into 2 aims
  * should have at least 3 aims
  * think of functional microbial analysis
  * try to nail down
 ### Next meeting: wednesday
   * what would help to get ready: analyzed dataset, rewritten aims, detailed bullet points of how to achieve aims exactly, introduction
   * 2pm Zoom 19th Feb
