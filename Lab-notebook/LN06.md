# LN06 - Core Microbiome and Differential Abundance Analysis

March 16, 2025

## Purpose:
To perform aim 2

## Material: 
1. RStudio
2. HIV_rare
3. HIV_Final

## Method:
### Differential abundance
1. Differential abundance testing was performed using DESeq2 on raw count data to identify genera significantly enriched or depleted between labor groups, education levels, and age groups (24).
2. Prior to analysis, taxa with low counts across all samples were filtered to reduce sparsity.
3. Comparisons were made pairwise across categorical variables, and genera with an adjusted P value < 0.01 and absolute log2 fold change > 2 were considered significantly differentially abundant.
4. Results were visualized using volcano plots and bar plots generated with ggplot2 (21).
### Core microbiome
1. Core microbiome analysis was performed using the microbiome package on the generated phyloseq object of HIV patients (HIV_final, 25).
2. Groups analyzed included labor category, education level, and age of HIV patients. Specifically, labor and non-labor HIV patients were compared together.
3. HIV patients who obtained primary, secondary, or tertiary education were compared together.
4. Lastly, HIV patients younger than 45 and older than 45 years old were compared together.
5. Core microbiomes were identified with a detection threshold of 0.001 and a prevalence threshold of 0.5.
6. Shared and unique taxa were visualized using Venn diagrams generated with the ggVennDiagram package (26).

## Code: 
This was done by multiple teammates and other codes can be viewed in the same folder
* [Core microbiome code](/RStudio/Aim2/475_AIM2.Rmd)
* [Differential abundance analysis](/RStudio/Susana's-Aim1-3.R)

## Output files:
Files are saved on Team OneDrive server or [GitHub](/RStudio/Figures)


## Results: 
* Increased unique species were found in the gut microbiome of patients who received tertiary education and who were younger than 45 but only minimal differences were found associated with patients' labor type

## Discussion:
* Education has some interesting unique species and stood out from the rest
