# Meeting with Hans on Zoom 
2-2:45pm Wednesday Feb 19th, 2025
## Agenda
 ### Research question: 
 - How does does social factors of people living with or without HIV affect the gut microbiome?
 -  How does gut microbiome of different labor and non-labor workers in Zimbabwe of different sexes in correlative with HIV outcome?



 ### Data Overview (Susana)
 
 ### Experimental aims:
Version 1

 * Aim 1: Evaluate gut microbiome composition of HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients belonging to to different occupational labor types 

 * Aim 2:  Evaluate the sex differences of gut microbiome composition between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. 

 * Aim 3: Investigate microbiome differences in the combined sex and labour subgroups to investigate the interactive effect of sex and labour on the gut microbiome in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients.


Version 2
 
 * Aim 1: Investigate how multiple social factors (labour type, education and HOH status) influence the gut microbiome (GM) in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. (using PERMANOVA)

 * Aim 2:  Identify which social factor has the most significant impact on the gut microbiome in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients (using multivariable regression analyses)

 * Aim 3: Investigate functional changes in the gut microbiome linked to the key social factor(s) identified in Aim 2 using differential abundance analysis (DESeq2).
   

 ### Outline the planned analysis (alpha, beta diversity, etc.)

 Version 1

 * Aim 1: Filter data to subdivide patient entries into HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups.
- Within HIV-positive and negative subgroups, further categorize patients into labor subtype - labor_carrying, labor_specialized, non_labour, unemployed
- Assess the alpha diversity of microbiome composition using Shannonâ€™s index (richness) within these specialized labor groups within HIV positive and negative patient subsets
- Assess the beta diversity of microbiome composition using weighted unifrac (community dissimilarity with phylogenetic relationships) between these specialized labor groups across both HIV positive and negative patient subsets 

Two different analyses:
- Same labor groups but comparing HIV+ vs HIV-Different labor groups within same HIV+ and HIV- cohort.
- Conduct an indicator species analysis to identify characterizing taxa that are indicative of a labor category

* Aim 2: Gut microbiome analysis using Indicator Species Analysis to identify if a particular bacterial taxa is consistently present and abundant in one of our subgroups but not in others
- On female and male HIV positive patients
- On female and male HIV negative patients

* Aim 3:
- Use a Chi-square test (or logistic regression) to assess the association between gender and labor status in HIV patients.
- Run DESeq2 analysis to identify microbial taxa that are differentially abundant between the subgroups
