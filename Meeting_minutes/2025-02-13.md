# Meeting with Hans on Zoom 
3:45-4:30pm Thursday
## Agenda
 ### Research question: Investigation of gut microbiome in HIV patients with different labour categories and related cortisol effects
 ### Experimental aims:
 * Aim 1: What is the gut microbiome composition and diversity within each labor category of HIV-positive and negative patients? (alpha diversity Shannon index)
 * Aim 2: How do occupational labor type influence gut microbiome composition in HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals? (beta diversity Weighted Unifrac, difference among labor types, between HIV +/-)
 * Aim 3: What is the corresponding cortisol level for each occupational labor type between HIV-positve and negative patients and difference between groups? (comparison and statistical test)
 * Aim 4: What is the relationship between occupational labor type, cortisol levels, and gut microbiome diversity in HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals? (correlation analysis)
 ### Outline the planned analysis (alpha, beta diversity, etc.)
 * outline above corresponding to each aim
 ### Feedback from Hans
