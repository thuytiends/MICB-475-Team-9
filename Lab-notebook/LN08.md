# LN07 - Functional analysis

March 21, 2025

## Purpose:
 Indicator species analysis (ISA) was used to identify genera significantly associated with specific sociodemographic categories. 

## Material: 
1. RStudio
2. QIIME2


## Method:
1. Predictive functional analysis was carried out using the Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt2) plugin for QIIME2 with Nearest Sequence Taxon Index (NSTI) set to 2 and features with 5 or fewer counts filtered out prior to analysis (28).
2. To perform the functional pathway analysis based on the indicator species of labor type, education level, and age, the following packages in RStudio were loaded: readr, ggpicrust2, tibble, tidyverse, ggprism, patchwork, DESeq2, ggh4x, dplyr, ggplot2, and gridExtra (17, 21, 24, 29â€“32).
3. The generated pathway abundance file was annotated using the MetaCyc database (33).
4. Pairwise comparisons of functional pathway abundances were performed between variables of education level, labor type, and age using DESeq2 (24).
5. For education, HIV patients completing primary or secondary education were combined to perform pairwise comparison with HIV patients completing tertiary education.
6. Pathways up or downregulated with an absolute log2 fold change > 2 and p-value < 0.05 were considered significantly dysregulated.
7. Dysregulated pathways were visualized with bar plots using ggplot2 

## Code: 
This was done by multiple teammates and other codes can be viewed in the same folder
* [Picrust2 code](/RStudio/Aim2/475_AIM2.Rmd)
* [QIIME2 Picrust](/QIIME2-Analysis/QIIME2-Data-Processing-Script.R)


## Output files:
Files are saved on Team OneDrive server or [GitHub](/RStudio/Figures)


## Results: 
Education and Age

## Discussion:
* Education has 4 unique pathways and stood out from the rest while age has one pathway
