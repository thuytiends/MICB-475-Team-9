## Meeting notes:
 * Progress on aim 1: phyloseq object in running and created, codes for alpha and beta diversity are being worked on to tailor to what our aim is
 * Question: We need to do an initial filter to only include patients on the second visit before stratifying the data to anything else. Does this filter step have to be done during phyloseq object analysis and rarefaction? Or can we just filter it after? Which is a better approach?
