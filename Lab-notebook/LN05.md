# LN05 - Alpha diversity for Education level, visit age, and labour type

March 14, 2025

## Purpose:
To import and convert metadata, phylogenetic tree, otu table, and taxonomy of HIV dataset to phyloseq object. 
To remove samples less than 100 reads, ASVs < 5 counts, any mitochondrial or chloroplast sequences, and remove NAs.
To rarefy the phlyoseq object to match with our general data processing step on QIIME2.

## Material: 
1. RStudio
2. HIV_rare

## Method:
1. Alpha and beta diversity analyses were done on RStudio (15).
2. The following packages were loaded to perform alpha and beta diversity analyses: phyloseq, ape, tidyverse, picante, ggsignif, ggplot2, vegan, and “car” (14, 16–20)
3. Alpha diversity was performed among labor type, education level, age visit, and HIV Status.
4. Associated Kruskal-Wallis and log-transformed analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical tests were performed using the ggsignif package (19).
5. Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) was used to measure richness using the phyloseq package (14).
6. To measure evenness, Shannon was first calculated using phyloseq and then used to calculate Pielou’s Evenness. Shannon values were calculated to perform Pielou’s Evenness.
7. Beta diversity was assessed using the phyloseq, ggplot2, and ggsignif packages (14, 19, 21).
8. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots were generated using Weighted UniFrac diversity metrics (22).
9. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and pairwise PERMANOVA statistical significance tests were performed using the vegan package (20, 23).

## Code: 
* [RStudio code](/RStudio/Aim1/alpha-beta-labortype.Rmd)
* QIIME2 codes were applied from MICB 475 lecture
## Output files:
Files are saved on Team OneDrive server
Various plots of alpha and beta diversity can be viewed [here](/RStudio/Figures)

## Results: 
* Most metrics are not significantly different, except for pielou's eveness of age
* Pielou's
    * Violin plot:

## Discussion:
* This summed up our aim 1 and we moved on to continnue to test the same variables for aim 2 and 3
