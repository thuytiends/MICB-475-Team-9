# Meeting to discuss research question and brainstorm aims
## Meeting Agenda:
### Logistics:
  * Use more GitHub:
    * Assign two people for the meeting minutes:
     * Alternating each week
       * Tien (week Feb 10th)
       * Thomas (next week, Feb 17th (reading break))
  * Everyone is responsible for doing lab notebook 
### Research questions, aims, and proposal discussion:
  * Interesting variables wanting to look at:
   *  could do 2 variables work and consumption
   *  HIV and socioeconomic factors (3 variables)
   *  Cortisol connecting to amount of exercise in HIV patients
    * High cortisol can influence immune cell composition
    * Cortisol: head of household, leisure activity, 6 hours of activities
    * New variables: Labor category (between HIV positive and negative patients) and Cortisol level
  * Research question: Investigation of gut microbiome in HIV patients with different labour categories and related cortisol
  * Experimental aims:
     * Aim 1: How do occupational labor type influence gut microbiome composition in HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals? (alpha diversity)
     * Aim 2: beta diversity Weighted unifrac 
     * Aim 3:
     * Aim 4: What is the relationship between occupational labor type, cortisol levels, and gut microbiome diversity in HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals?
  * Outline the analysis (alpha, beta diversity, etc.)
