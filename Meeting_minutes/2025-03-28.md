# MEETING WITH HANS AND EVELYNN ABOUT OUR PRESENTATION 
### (by Thomas 😎)

## Slide number:
1. Title is not conclusive, will meet over the weekend to figure it out.
2. Background
3. Cool animations
4. Research Q.
5. Background for research q. One thing we should emphasize is that sociodemographic metadata are not looked at it, and we should work to humanize these factors. Highlight the fact that there is a lack of research between the gut microbiome and human factors. 
6. Hypothesis
7. Aim 1 --> p-value table. There is one significiant comparison in Pielou's evenness between age and the gut microbiota in HIV+ patients. The difference is not big, and FDR has not been done. For the paper, use p-values instead of colors. Color the p-values or add a opaque background fill to the cell (binary yes or no is okay, no need gradient). Evenlynn inquires about education. Maybe we should clarify the bins (primary, secondary, tertiary) and what they mean. Hans mentions that the colon is probably a bad way of listing the factors, instead use "Labor vs Non-labor" instead of "Labor: Non-labor". Evenlynn says she wouldn't dig into it, difference is too small.
8. Hidden
9. Hidden
10. Aim 2 core microbiome analysis. The p-values are very small (nvm fixed!). The numbers are "species in common". Evelynn inquires about the threshold and deduces that it is 0. Keep adjusting it so it's more stringent than 0. Hans says prevalence 0.1 is still too low (not meaningful). All 3 sociodemographic factors have more shared than unique. Interesting that folks who go completed tertiary education have less shared microbiome compared to secondary & primary. Align the labels verticall & horizontally.
11. ISA for education. Data aligns with core microbiome. Hans and Evelynn have beef. This almost suggest that people who completed tertiary education have long-term microbiome effects, but not necessarily a bad thing (despite the presence of Negativibacillus species). This is devolving into a commentary on diet and university life. Does university education correlate with a worsening diet? Stay tuned! Acknowledge thaat ISA = 0.53 is not great. All species listed are pathogenic. The moral of the story is don't go to college.
12. ISA for labor and age. For labor there is only one and it is sad (ISA = 0.58). For age, 5 for >45, 4 for < 45. All ISA values are sad (only one is close to 0.7). Remove ones below 0.5 (purge the heretics ⚔️⚔!). Evelynn is trying to push her agenda of teritary being bad for our microbiome.
13. DA DESeq. THE FONT 🔍! Hans is not a fan of these graphs but we got them from Evelynn's modules. Labor vs non-labor, filtered for top 10 (that's good). Aging is good too. Evelynn comments there are nuanced small changes based on the sociodemographic factors. Prevotella is showing up a lot (there are 4 for age), and we can group them based on whether we want to show the graph at the species or genus level (Evenlynn says it doesn't mean much, only a quality education at UBC does!).
14. ??
15. Volcano plots --> remove NA and make false the grey color instead. The volcano plots show that aging has the most DA genes (Evelynn says "darn it" because it's not education).

I've lost control of the slide number, it's free for all from here 🫡.

- We showed the heatmaps and Evelynn was like NAH 🤢 show me the bar plots instead but we don't have them ready
- We have the aging bar plots!
- We got to filter it for +/- 2 but maybe 1.5 is okay.
- That's basically our data. We've collected the data we planned to in our aim, and it is a story.
- Now Hans is a supporter of teritary education.
- In the grand scheme of things, there are no meaningfully large effects of these sociodemographic factors on HIV.
- Hans: "the metadata is not helpful". Evenlynn: "NAHH I wouldn't say that".
- We could expand our metadata factors? We looked a close-knit cohort in Zimbabwe so maybe the changes in their sociodemographic factors were not meaningful enough.
- Sitting and cortisol time are also not helpful.

## Figures
  - Table 1 is alpha/beta diversity p-values, stick the Pielou's evenness in Figure S1.
  - Figure 1 (core microbiome) is A) B) C) for each of the 3 factors (each venn diagram is one factor).
  - Table 2 is indicator taxa (all in one table, use headers), cut off of ISA = 0.5 of higher and acknolwedge limitation.
  - Figure 2 (DEseq) with volcano plots ONLY. We have 5 volcano plots. 5 panels, one for each plot.
  - Figure S2 --> bar graphs. Don't subset, keep them raw.
  - Figure HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM piecrust is a placeholder for figure 3, use bar plots only (heatmaps are less useful).
 
  - Order:
  - Table 1 (a/b diversity)
  - Figure 1 (core microbiome)
  - Table 2 (ISA)
  - Figure 2 (volcano plots)
  - Figure 3 (piecrust)
  - Figure S1 (Pielou's evenness)
  - Figure S2 (DEseq bar graphs)

## BYE HANS :( 😭😭😭😭 👋
  - Meeting is 15:10 instead of 15:00 for next week.
  - Evenlynn: "🥺 HIV- data 👉👈"
  - Hans is defending us god bless i need to work on my thesis. Future directions.
