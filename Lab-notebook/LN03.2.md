# LN03.2 - Alpha rarefaction

Macrh 1st, 2025

## Purpose:
To determine the taxonomic groups to which the ASVs correspond to, and to generate a taxonomy bar plot that illustrates the relative frequency of each taxonomic group. To perform taxonomy-based filtering and remove any mitochondria or chloroplast sequences.

## Material: 
1. QIIME2 
2. 243-rep_seqs.qzv (/HIV)
3. hiv_metadata.tsv (/mnt/datasets/project_2/hiv/hiv_metadata.tsv)
4. hiv_table-no-mitochondria-no-chloroplast.qza (/HIV)
3. 243_table.qza (/HIV)



## Method:
1. Connect to Cisco Anyconnect Secure VPN. Open the terminal and login to MICB 475 class server using the provided login credentials.
2. Generate a tree for phylogenetic diversity analyses.
3. View the table to see maximum frequency in order to determine max depth for the alpha-rarefaction.
3. Generate alpha-rarefaction curve with a max depth of 60 000.
4. Transfer the alpha-rarefaction file to local computer and view the alpha-rarefaction curve using view.QIIME2.org.
