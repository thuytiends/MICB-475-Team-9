# Meeting with Hans #
## Location: LSI, time: 3pm
## Agenda:
  * Wrap up aim 1 result
  * Aim 2 discussion
  * Ask for feedback
  * Questions regarding codes
## Meeting notes:
### Aim 1 updates
### Labor type
  * Thomas presenting our plots from aim 1
  * Shannon and Chao1: significant in Labor and non-labor?
  * Pielou: didn't have time to do HIV Status affecting socioeconomic status
  * Taxonomic bar plots: needs to do RA, and you're plotting ASVs, you need to average out by experimental groups, don't do ASVs. Then you can see the taxonmic bar plots better
  * violin plots: no need to include points,
  * need to think about you're going to show it in the paper
#### try to show a matrix of data => e.g. heatmaps => summarize all the data you have. Consider summarizing it. One heatmap per matrix (diveristy, Shannon, Chao1, Pielou, etc.) 

### Aim 2: Updates from Savitha
 * Savitha thinks there are some data interpretation not making sense
 * ISA: don't know how to resolve => can use one of the QIIME2 output file => output data 2 onwards
 * Overall, we found some interesting core microbiome and indicator species 

### All the data figures format by march 21st, better to discuss as we have
