# Meeting with Hans #
## Location: LSI, time: 3pm
## Last meeting of February!
## Agenda:
  * Discuss project progress: Aim 1: alpha and beta diversity of labor types
  * Advice on how to allocate work, what worked best for the teams in the past
  * Any other points from team wanting to bring up to Hans
  * Any other points from Hans wanting to bring up to team
## Meeting notes:
 * Progress on aim 1: phyloseq object in running and created, codes for alpha and beta diversity are being worked on to tailor to what our aim is
 * Question: We need to do an initial filter to only include patients on the second visit before stratifying the data to anything else. Does this filter step have to be done during phyloseq object analysis and rarefaction? Or can we just filter it after? Which is a better approach?
    * filter before or after phyloseq
    * still be okay with only 2nd visit patients
    * can filter before and rarefy
 * How was your experience with the proposal:
    * can resubmit after feedback from markers
    * can get an increase in %
 * Advice on how to allocate work, what worked best for the teams in the past:
    * very dependent on group dynamics
    * can alternate, see what the members care about, it should work for you
    * most people do by aims, while the other work
    * aim 3 is the hardest, try to work together on it
    * you can do aim 2 and 3 concurrently
    * core gives you venn, volcano plots use ancom (suggested by Hans)
 * What Hans wants to bring up: presentation:
    * what works quite well for previous group: try to have data in raw form two Fridays before the presentation
    * clean them up, and make presentation, try to make it effort and can discuss stories together: lay the slide figure 1, connecting to next figure, make slide for next friday, discuss story together as a group => this way you can have aa story and result down for manuscript => really help you out for the April period
    * think about what figure you want it to be in manusciprt: alpha beta diversity plot, PcoA, bullet points and key takeaways for the figure
    * present other group's work: they will coach you and you will present
    * very important you come up with a clean story => benefit your grade the way you present
    * Feb 21st onwards: work towards presentations - can put them in supplementary figures
    * For figures: PLEASE be consistent wiht same style across three aims, pick one you like as a theme to agree for the group, use COLORBLIND
SAFE, colorrule2 - add a blue hue, etc.
    * For fig stat, is there a general convention? not really, just use the stars 
  * Steven's question: course related: is final goal just manuscript? yes
    * but main grade proportion comes from manuscript draft
### All the data figures format by march 21st, better to discuss as we have
