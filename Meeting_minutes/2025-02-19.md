# Meeting with Hans on Zoom 
2-2:45pm Wednesday Feb 19th, 2025
## Agenda
 ### Research question: 
 - How does does social factors of people living with or without HIV affect the gut microbiome?
 -  How does gut microbiome of different labor and non-labor workers in Zimbabwe of different sexes in correlative with HIV outcome?



 ### Data Overview (Susana)
 
 ### Experimental aims:
Version 1

 * Aim 1: Evaluate gut microbiome composition of HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients belonging to to different occupational labor types 

 * Aim 2:  Evaluate the sex differences of gut microbiome composition between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. 

 * Aim 3: Investigate microbiome differences in the combined sex and labour subgroups to investigate the interactive effect of sex and labour on the gut microbiome in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients.


Version 2
 
 * Aim 1: Investigate how multiple social factors (labour type, education and HOH status) influence the gut microbiome (GM) in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients.

 * Aim 2:  Identify which social factor has the most significant impact on the gut microbiome in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients (using multivariable regression analyses)

 * Aim 3: Investigate functional changes in the gut microbiome linked to the key social factor(s) identified in Aim 2 using differential abundance analysis (DESeq2).
