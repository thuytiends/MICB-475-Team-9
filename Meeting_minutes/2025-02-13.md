# Meeting with Hans on Zoom 
3:45-4:30pm Thursday Feb 13th, 2025
## Agenda
 ### Research question: Investigation of gut microbiome in HIV patients with different labour categories and related cortisol effects
 * when is this cortisol amount collected? before or after
 * good, novel question, research question is more of a title - try to set a big question
 * being graded on the rubric - look at the rubric
 ### Experimental aims:
 * Aim 1: What is the gut microbiome composition and diversity within each labor category of HIV-positive and negative patients? (alpha diversity Shannon index). How do occupational labor type influence gut microbiome composition in HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals? (beta diversity Weighted Unifrac, difference among labor types, between HIV +/-)
 * Aim 2: What is the corresponding cortisol level for each occupational labor type between HIV-positve and negative patients and difference between groups? (comparison and statistical test). What is the relationship between occupational labor type, cortisol levels, and gut microbiome diversity in HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals? (correlation analysis)
 ### Outline the planned analysis (alpha, beta diversity, etc.)
 * Aim 1: alpha diversity Shannon index
 * Aim 2: Beta diversity weighted Unifrac
  * statistical comparison between labor types within HIV+/-, between HIV + and -
 * Aim 3: Comparison and statistical test
 * Aim 4: Correlation analysis PCoA 
 ### Feedback from Hans
 #### Research question
 * set it as a question
 #### Aims
 * Fixed the aims above, originally there were 4 aims, aims need greater expectations
 * Go through the QIIME2 analysis for the dataset first: rarefaction curve, analysis, look for example of proposal online - see if you end up losing all the samples 
 * Don't ask for alternative rurbic marking (without data analysis) => more vague and you won't know what you're doing
 * Envision to have one aim per figure/panel
 * Try to set aims as statements, examples below (what and why structure)
   *  Develop a computational pipeline for microbe community 
   *  Characterize microbial dynamics and osmotic stress in the gut
   *  Develop an assay to xyz
 * Aim 1 and 2 should be combined
 * Aim 3: need to manipulate your data at this point to have a better understanding (should also be combined with 4)
   * If you were to turn cortisol level into categories, need evidence to back it up (what's considered high, low, med?)
   * Still sounds like it's diversity analysis
  * Aim 4:
   * Looking at 3 categorical variable +/-, labor type, cortisol level
   * You can do this but this is going to be a lot of combinations => need to work with that and get useful data out of it
  * should have at least 3 aims
  * think of functional microbial analysis
 #### Overall: need written statement for aims (what and why structure), expand your aims to other analysis other than diversity analysis (Module 14-16), ANALYZE your data so you know what you're getting yourself into and will significantly help with addressing aims
 ### Next meeting: Wednesday 19th Feb 2PM Zoom
   * What would help to get ready: analyzed dataset, rewritten aims, detailed bullet points of how to achieve aims exactly, introduction
