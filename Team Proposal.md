Team proposal outline:

## Introduction and Background
Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is a virus that causes infection in humans, marked by an exaggerated depeletion of CD4+ helper T-cells in the blood, eventually developing into acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Much progress has been made in developed countries to quell the spread of HIV-1, including safe-sex practices, pre-exposure and post-exposure anti-retroviral treatment (ART). 
Unfortunately, 70% of global HIV infections are localized to sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), a region where coverage and access to ART is lacking. While much focus has been directed at understanding HIV biology, its effects on the immune system and how routes of exposure increases chance of infection, recent research has uncovered the importance of the gut microbiome in HIV infections and prognosis. 
Furthermore, little research has been dedicated to investigating how the gut microbiota in HIV positive individuals differ is influenced more social factors, such as stress, occupation, water source, grain source. Given the importance of the gut microbiome in other diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzhimer's disease and cancer, this project aims to understand how infection by HIV changes the gut microbiome in people with different types of occupation and levels of stress (measured by blood cortisol levels).
